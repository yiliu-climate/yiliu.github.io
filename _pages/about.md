# Bio
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) working with [**Dr. Michael Mcphaden**](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gtmba/curriculum-vitae), supported by the National Research Council Research Associateship Program. I got my PhD degree in 2024 from Ocean University of China, under a joint supervision with [**Dr. Xiaopei Lin**](https://pol.ouc.edu.cn/2020/0526/c18667a288318/page.htm) at Ocean University of China and [**Dr. Wenju Cai**](https://www.science.org.au/profile/wenju-cai) at CSIRO, Melbourne Australia. My research interests include: (1) tropical Atlantic climate variability, with impacts on hurricanes and regional rainfall; (2) trans-basin climate interaction; (3) socioeconomic impacts of tropical climate variability. I have published 10 papers at the high-impact journals in the field, including Nature Climate Change, Nature Communications, and Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, with 5 papers as the first author.
